# Input

The Cities React application takes input from users in two main section. Users input the name, country, population, and other details of a new city via input fields in the "Add City" form. Users can also select a city from the list displayed in the "Cities List" section by clicking on the city's name. This selection triggers the display of detailed information about the chosen city.

# Process

The application processes the input through several steps. React Router handles navigation between different components and routes, enabling the display of the "Cities List", "Add City", and city details pages. The application uses React's state management to store and update the list of cities. The useState hook manages the state of the cities array. The application renders the input data using components like 'CitiesList', 'AddCity', and 'CityDetails'. The selected city's unique identifier is obtained using the 'useParams' hook for displaying detailed information.

# Output

The application displays a list of cities with clickable links to individual city detials pages. Users input for a new city is processed and added to the list of cities. The user is redirected to the "cities List" after successful submission. Clicking on a city's name displays its detailed information on the same page layout as the "Cities List".
Cities application's input-process-output model revolves around users providing city data, the application processing and displaying that data through components and routes, and ultimately presenting a user-friendly interface to view and manage city information
