I used React Native to develop todos app. I will be using React Native to build todos app using JavaScript. 
I followed the following procedure to create mobile app:
1.	Install the Expo CLI by running the following code in the terminal.

                npm install -g expo-cli
2.	Create a new Expo project by running the following command.

                expo init CityApp
This will create a new directory called “HelloWord” with a basic Expo project structure.
3.	Navigate into the project directory:

                cd CityApp
4.	Open App.js and make changes to this app code. I added some components as:

    I created four folder under root folder and in the src folder:

                        AddCity
                        AddCountry
                        CitiesNav
                        CountriesNav

    Also create components like:
    
                        CenterMessage

5. The app works by adding the list of cities, countries, and their currency. The entered cities and countries with their currency is listed out in the Cities and Countries Tab
6.	Start the Expo development server by running the following command:

                expo start --tunnel
7.	Install the Expo Go app on your mobile device from the app store.
8.	Use the Expo Go app to scan the QR code displayed in the Expo Developer tools which will load your app on your mobile device.
